# README

Todo list app created using vanilla Javascript. Project guidelines can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list.

In this project, I utilized modules and observers heavily for the first time. I also utilized `html-webpack-plugin` and `date-fns` plugins, and storing data locally using `localstorage`.
